## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Vue.js 3 (CDN):** Core framework for reactivity and UI rendering.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Game logic and interactions.
- **HTML5:** Structure of the game interface.
- **CSS3:** Styling for the visual presentation.

## üí° Key Vue.js Concepts Demonstrated

This project showcases the practical application of several core Vue.js features:

- **Data Management:** Using the `data()` option to manage reactive game state (`playerHealth`, `monsterHealth`, `currentRound`, etc.).
- **Methods:** Defining game actions (`attackMonster`, `healPlayer`, `specialAttackMonster`, etc.) within the `methods` option.
- **Computed Properties:** Calculating derived state dynamically (e.g., `monsterBarStyles`, `playerBarStyles`, `mayUseSpecialAttack`).
- **Watchers:** Reacting to state changes to trigger side effects (e.g., determining the `winner` when health changes).
- **Conditional Rendering:** Using `v-if` to show/hide elements based on game state (e.g., game over screen, controls).
- **List Rendering:** Using `v-for` to display the dynamic battle log (`logMessages`).
- **Attribute Binding:** Dynamically binding styles (`:style`) and attributes (`:disabled`).
- **Event Handling:** Using `@click` to trigger methods on user interaction.
